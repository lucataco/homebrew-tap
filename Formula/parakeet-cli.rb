    <<~EOS
      parakeet requires Apple Silicon (M1 or later) and macOS.

      Run once before transcribing:
        parakeet download

      This downloads the Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 model to:
        ~/Library/Application Support/parakeet/models/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3/

      The Silero VAD model is downloaded automatically on first:
        parakeet listen
        parakeet serve

      Quick start:
        parakeet download
        parakeet devices
        parakeet listen

      Daemon mode:
        parakeet serve
        echo "toggle" | nc -U "$HOME/Library/Application Support/parakeet/run/daemon.sock"

      Daemon stdout uses newline-delimited JSON (protocol 2).
      Read transcript text from complete events. Send "partials": true with
      start to stream interim text, and "keep_warm": true with stop to keep
      the microphone open for the next recording.
